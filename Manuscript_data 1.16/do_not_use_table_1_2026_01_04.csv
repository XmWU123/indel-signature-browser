					ID_P												
																	
a The signatures in Koh et al. that were not detected in the current study consist of:																	
    2 InD signatures that were not found in tumors that we analyzed. 																	
    4 InD signatures that are artefacts per Koh et al. 																	
    7 InD signatures that can be reconstructed by combinations of<= 3 InsDel singatures (Table S1).																	
    4 InD signatures are the split of InsDel signatures.																	
b The key difference stems from the reduced 1-bp T insertions in 5+ T homopolymers within the COSMIC signatures.																	
																	
ND: No data due to small number of tumors with signature
