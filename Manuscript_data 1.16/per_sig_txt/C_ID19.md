The 476-type InsDel19b extraction collapses to 83-type signature close to C_ID19, with the addition of a small proportion of singe-T deletions in the context long poly-T contexts.

The 476-type InsDel1a extraction collapsed to the 83-type representation has 15% single-T insertion in long poly-T contexts that are absent from C_ID19, as well as additional single-C and single-T deletions and single-T insertions that are absent in C_ID19.

The 476-type InsDel1c extraction collapsed to the 83-type representation has single-C and single-T deletions that are absent C_ID19
