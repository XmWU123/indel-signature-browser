In the 89-type classification, InsDel16 and InsDel11 have a cosine similarity of 0.965, but as extracted from the 476-type
classification, InsDel11 differs obviously from InsDel16, with insertion of
single Cs next to isolated Cs (Cs with non-Cs on each side)
and insertion of single Ts 
next to isolated Ts.

By contrast, InsDel_C has insertions of Cs between non-Cs and Gs, and insertion of Ts between non-Ts.
