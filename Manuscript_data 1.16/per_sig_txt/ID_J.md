Deletions and insertions of T in long poly-T contexts were removed from the 83-type spectrum.

ID_N has a larger proportion of 2-base deletions in the longest category of 2-base repeats
(simple tandem repeats) than ID_J, plus some 3-base and 4-base deletions.  40% of ID_J indels are
2-base deletions in the longest category of 2-base repeats, and essentially lacks 3-base 
and 4-base deletions.

WARNING: The 83-type ID_J extraction excluded the large proportion (60%) of T deletions in long poly-T contexts
that were detected in extractions in the 89-type and 476-type
classifications. 

These single T deletions in long poly-T contexts are present in the 83-type signature collapsed from the 476-type InsDel_J 
signature, which makes the deletions of 2 bases hard to see in the plot. 
However, since we are collapsing from 476-categories that does not capture the differences between ID_J and ID_N very well, the differences between ID_J and ID_N are not visible.
