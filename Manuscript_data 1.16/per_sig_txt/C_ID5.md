WARNING: The 83-type signature C_ID5 corresponds to both InsDel5a and InsDel5b.
The C_ID5 extraction mainly excluded T deletions in long poly-T contexts
that were detected in InsDel5b in extractions in the 89-type and 476-type
classification, but not in the InsDel5a extractions. Thus, C_ID5 corresponds more closely to InsDel5a than to InsDel5b
