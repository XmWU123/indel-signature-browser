InsDel_J and InsDel_N cannot be distinguished in the 89-type representation because differences between are all subsumed in the set of deletions annotated L(2, ):U(1,2):R(5, ). These can be distinguished in the 83-type classification and, with difficulty in the 476-type classification. See notes under ID_J, below.
