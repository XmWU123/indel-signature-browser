InsDel_C looks somewhat similar to InsDel_13 in prominence of deletions of Ts that are followed by A.  However, the 83-type and 476-type classifications show that InsDel13 has deletions of 2 Ts while InsDel_C has deletions of 1 T.

Nevertheless, InsDel13 and InsDel_C were extracted separately, possibly because of the insertion of isolated Ts in InsDel13 but not InsDel_C
