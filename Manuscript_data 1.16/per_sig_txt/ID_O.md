Deletions and insertions of T in long poly-T contexts were removed from the 83-type spectrum.

WARNING: The 83-type ID_O extraction excluded the large proportion
of T insertions in long poly-T contexts that
were detected in extractions in the 89-type and 476-type
classifications.

In the plot of the 83-type signature converted from the extracted 476-type 
signature these account for 75% of mutations and the other mutation classes are barely visible.
