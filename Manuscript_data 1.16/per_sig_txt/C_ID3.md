WARNING: The 83-type signature C_ID3 corresponds to both InsDel3a and InsDel3b.
The C_ID3 extraction mainly excluded T deletions in long poly-T contexts
that were detected in InsDel3a in extractions in the 89-type and 476-type
classification, but not in the InsDel3b extractions. Thus, C_ID5 corresponds more closely to InsDel3b than to InsDel3a
