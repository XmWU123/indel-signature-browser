WARNING: The 83-type ID_C extraction seems to have excluded T deletions 
and insertions in most contexts, leaving only isolated T deletions 
(nonT)T(nonT) -> (nonT)(nonT).
The other T deletions and insertions were detected in extractions in the 89-type and 476-type
classifications. This proportion was 10% for InsDel_K_alpha and approximately 17% for InsDel_K_beta.
