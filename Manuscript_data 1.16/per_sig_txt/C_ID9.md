We believe that the signature C_ID9 that we extracted corresponds to COSMIC signature ID9, even though C_ID9 has a large proportion of deletions of single thymines in long poly-T contexts, which ID9 completely lacks. 
We believe this an instance of "over splitting" due to all such deletions being allocated to a single mutation type in the 83-type indel classification. 

TODO STEVE REVISE THIS Furthermore, Koh, Nanda, et al.'s extraction from 89-type spectra and our extraction from related type-476 spectra indicate > 3% of indels are insertions of single thymines in long poly-T contexts. 

ID9 also lacks insertions and deletions of sequences longer than 1 base, but these insertions and deletions are present in C_ID9 and in extractions from 89-type and 476-type spectra, which would seem to support C_ID9 versus ID9.
