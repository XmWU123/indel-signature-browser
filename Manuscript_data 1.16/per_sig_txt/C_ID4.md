WARNING: The 83-type ID_4 extraction excluded the large proportion
of T insertions in long poly-T contexts that
were detected in extractions of InsDel4b in the 89-type and 476-type
classifications. These single T insertions were not extracted in the 89-type and 476-type 
InsDel4a signature. Thus, C_ID4 corresponds more closely to InsDel4a than to InsDel4b
